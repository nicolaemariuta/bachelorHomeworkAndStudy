================================================================

A) Installing Synplify on a Unix Workstation 

   The installation instructions in this example show you how to
   install a Synplify license on a Sun SPARCstation running Solaris 
   2.5.1 or greater or an HP workstation running HP-UX 10.20.

    Installation Steps

        Note:  The following characters indicate whether or not 
               you are logged into the root account:

               (#) pound character indicates the UNIX C-shell prompt 
                   when you are logged into the "root" account. 
                %  percent character indicates you are not logged in 
                   as "root."

        1. Insert the Synplify CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive. 

        2. Using a non-root account, type:

           %  volcheck
           %  cd /cdrom/synplcty/<platform>  (<platform> is 
                                              "solaris" or "hp")
           %  more readme.txt  (Displays the readme.txt file 
                                telling you where to find the 
                                latest information)
           %  ./install.sh     (Installs Synplify)

           Do not use "root" privileges when typing the preceding
           commands.

        The installation shell script guides you through the 
        installation procedure to create the "synplcty" 
        directory.  After the "install.sh" script finishes, 
        set up your Synplify license. For license setup instructions, 
        refer to the license setup section that best fits your 
        licensing environment and type of Synplify license.

======================================================================

B)  Setting Up a Unix Workstation Customer License

    You must Install Synplify before proceeding with these licensing 
    instructions. See "Installing Synplify on a Unix Workstation" for 
    instructions.
    
    Synplicity offers two types of Unix licenses, node-locked and
    floating. A node-locked Synplify license lets you execute Synplify
    only on the machine for which it was licensed. A floating Synplify
    license lets you and your coworkers execute Synplify across a 
    network of Synplify-supported Windows on NT, Sun Solaris, and HP
    HP-UX systems, up to the number of seats your license supports.
    
    To enable your license, configure a "license server" to monitor 
    your Synplify licenses.  You can configure any Synplify-supported 
    platform as the license server.

======================================================================

C)  Unix Workstations as License Servers, 
       System Administrators Setup Procedures 

    These instructions explain how to configure a Synplify 
    license server for both node-locked and floating licenses, 
    where the license server is on a Unix workstation. 

    If you want to use a Unix Workstation as your license 
    server, but you have not configured license servers, refer to 
    "Unix Workstations as License Servers, Beginners Setup 
    Procedures."

    If you want to use a Windows NT system as your license
    server, refer to "PC NT Machines as License Servers."

    The Synplify install script installs the platform-specific 
    FLEXlm utilities for each platform in the corresponding 
    "../synplcty/<platform>" directory.  For example, the 
    FLEXlm utilities for a Solaris license server are in the 
    "../synplcty/solaris" directory structure.

   
 Licensing Steps

    1. Locate the Synplicity Software Authorization Form in 
       your product shipment (or your authorization fax or 
       email). The Synplicity Software Authorization Form 
       contains your Synplify software license. If you are 
       missing this information, contact Synplicity 

          email: support@synplicity.com 
          phone: (408) 548-6000 
          call your local sales representative

    2. Enter your Synplify license into your existing or new 
       "license.dat" file.

    3. Run the appropriate lmgrd or lmreread utility in the 
       directory that matches the platform of your license 
       server. You can run the lmgrd and lmreread utilities as 
       any nonprivileged user. To avoid errors, do NOT run  
       lmgrd or lmreread utilities as root!
 
    You can now run Synplify. If you have difficulties 
    installing or licensing Synplify, contact Synplicity 

          email: support@synplicity.com 
          phone: (408) 548-6000 
          call your local sales representative 

    Please fill out the Synplicity Software Registration Form 
    that came with your customer shipment, then return it to 
    Synplicity.

==================================================================

D) UNIX Workstations as License Servers, Beginners Setup Procedures

    Use these instructions if you are a novice at setting up
    software "license servers".  Synplify uses the FLEXlm license 
    manager software for its licensing software. 
    
    The "license server" program runs special software that tracks
    the number of licenses currently in use and who is using them. 
    The license server can run on the same computer that is running 
    Synplify, or it can be on a completely different computer. The 
    license server can reside on any Synplify-supported platform, 
    including a PC running Windows NT, a Sun SPARCstation running 
    Solaris, or an HP workstation running HP-UX.
    
    Synplicity offers two types of Unix licenses, node-locked 
    and floating. With a node-locked Synplify license, you can 
    execute Synplify only on the machine for which it was 
    licensed.  With floating Synplify licenses, you and your 
    coworkers can execute Synplify across a network of Synplify-
    supported Windows NT, Sun Solaris, and HP HP-UX systems, up
    to the number of seats your license supports.

    These instructions explain how to set up a Synplify license 
    server for both node-locked and floating licenses where the 
    license server is on a Unix workstation. 
    
    If you want to use a Windows NT system as your license
    server, refer to section "PC NT Machines as License Servers"
    in the pc installation instructions. 

    The assistance of a system administrator can be helpful, if 
    one is available. Also, read the section "UNIX Workstations 
    as License Servers, System Administrators Setup Procedures." 

    Important! While following the licensing steps below, make
               substitutions as outlined below that correctly 
               specify your environment when you enter commands.

           -   Replace <synplicity_home> with the name of the path 
               that describes the network location of your Synplify
               software.

           -   Replace <platform> with the system type that hosts your
               "license server". "solaris" and "hp" are the valid
               platform strings.

           -   Replace <license_file_path> with the name of the path 
               that describes the network location of your "
               license.dat" file.

    Licensing Steps

    1. Locate your Synplify authorization information.

       A) Locate your Synplicity Software Authorization Form in 
          your product shipment (or your authorization fax or 
          email). Your Synplicity Software Authorization Form 
          contains your Synplify software license. 

      B)  If you are missing your Synplify software license, 
          contact Synplicity:

                email: support@synplicity.com 
                phone: (408) 548-6000, 
                call:  your local sales representative

          Be prepared to supply the <host_id> and <host_name> strings.
          To get this information, you can use these commands:

          1) Enter the following string at your command prompt 
             to determine the <host_id> string of your machine:

             % <synplicity_home>/synplcty/<platform>/lmhostid

          2) Enter this string at your command prompt to 
             determine the <host_name> string of your machine:

             % hostname
 
    2. Enter your authorization information

       A) Enter your authorization information (or copy it, if 
          you received an electronic copy) into a "license.dat" 
          file. Put this license file anywhere you want, EXCEPT
          in the Synplicity software directory, "synplcty," so that 
          it doesn't get overwritten in a future installation to 
          upgrade the software.

       B) Update the DAEMON line in the "license.dat" file 
          to the full path for the Synplicity license 
          daemon. Change: 

     DAEMON synplctyd synplcty/synplctyd

           to:

     DAEMON synplctyd <synplicity_home>/synplcty/<platform>/synplctyd

       C) If you did not send a host name when requesting your 
          license, you must update the SERVER line in the 
          "license.dat" file as shown in the example bellow. 
          If you DID send a host name, continue with Step 3.

          Example:  SERVER <host_name> <host_id> 1701

          Replace <host_name> with the host name of the system
          that hosts your license server, and verify that the 
          <host_id> is correct. If the <host_name> string is
          incorrect, you can correct the string. If the <host_id>
          is correct, call Synplicity immediately at (408) 548-6000
          or email support@synplicity.com to get an updated license.
 
    3. Start the Synplicity License Manager Daemon. To prevent 
       security violations, DO NOT perform this step while 
       logged into the "root" account.  Perform this step while 
       logged into the system as a nonprivileged user.

       A) Enter the following string at your command prompt to 
          start the Synplicity license manager daemon:

          % <synplicity_home>/synplcty/<platform>/lmgrd \
            -l /usr/tmp/lmgrd.log -c <full_license_file_path>

          Notes:
          1) The -l switch specifies the destination of the FLEXlm
             log file.

          2) The -c switch specifies that your license file will be
             used. 
 
       B) Based on your system environment, enter one of the 
          following commands to verify that your Synplicity 
          license manager daemon is running:

            % ps -auxw | grep lmgrd
		or
	    % ps -ef | grep lmgrd

          If the daemon is running, the system lists "lmgrd"
          as a currently executing process.
 
    4. For each client system--that is, each user account that  
       is to execute Synplify--set the LM_LICENSE_FILE 
       environment variable to instruct FLEXlm where to find 
       the Synplify license. The client system can be the same
       system as your license server, but this is a requirement. 
       The client system can be any Synplify-supported system
       on the network that can access the "license.dat" file.
 
       Complete these instructions for all Unix clients:

       A) The LM_LICENSE_FILE variable tells FLEXlm where to 
          find your license file. To see if your LM_LICENSE_FILE 
          variable is already defined, enter the following command 
          at the command prompt:

          %  echo $LM_LICENSE_FILE
 
          In Steps 4B and 4C (you must complete either 4B or 4C, 
          but not both), substitute your valid <licnserv> string 
          into the command. Using the <licnserv> string lets you 
          specify your license file without entering an explicit
          filename. Using the <licnserv> is highly recommended.  
          Create a <licnserv> string as follows: 
 
          <port_number>@<host_name>
   
          For example, if your "license.dat" file has the
          following "SERVER" line:

          SERVER  bigdaddyhost  12345678  1701

          "1701" is your <port_number> string; "bigdaddyhost" 
          is your <host_name> string.  Your <licnserv> string is 
          "1701@bigdaddyhost" which is a concatenation of the 
          <port_number> and <host_name> strings.
         
          Create your <licnserv> string now, before continuing.
 
          B) If the LM_LICENSE_FILE variable IS NOT DEFINED, 
             set the LM_LICENSE_FILE variable to find your 
             license file using one of the options below:

             From a C shell, enter:
                 %  setenv LM_LICENSE_FILE <licnserv>

             From a Korn or Bourne shell, enter:
                 $  LM_LICENSE_FILE=<licnserv>
                 $  export LM_LICENSE_FILE

          C) If the LM_LICENSE_FILE variable IS DEFINED, there 
             are license files in use by other software.  In 
             this case, reset your LM_LICENSE_FILE environment 
             variable, adding your license file to the list:

             Important! If a <licnserv> (or full pathname) for
                        an old Synplicity "license.dat" file is 
                        in the LM_LICENSE_FILE list, remove it
                        from the list when you reset the 
                        LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable.

             When using multiple license files, the <port_number> 
             string on the SERVER line must be unique for each 
             license file.  If the Synplicity license file would 
             cause a duplication, change its <port_number> string 
             to another valid and unique port number; to avoid 
             duplication, use a valid port number that is greater
             than any of the other ports currently in use.

             To reset your LM_LICENSE_FILE variable:

             1) From a C shell, enter:

     % setenv LM_LICENSE_FILE <licnserv_1>:..:<licnserv_n>:<licnserv>

                Where <licnserv_1> through <licnserv_n> represent
                other license files.  You may see <licnserv> 
                strings expressed as full pathnames to the license 
                file.  However, this is not recommended for Synplicity
                software. Also, notice the use of the colon (:) as a 
                delimiting character between <licnserv> strings.

             2) From a Korn or Bourne shell, enter:

      $ LM_LICENSE_FILE=<licnserv_1>:..:<licnserv_n>:<licnserv>
      $ export LM_LICENSE_FILE

          If your license server is hosted by a Unix system, but 
          your client software is executes on a Windows NT system, 
          complete the steps described in Step 5 after completing the 
          remainder of Step 4.

          D) Enter the string below at the command prompt to verify 
             the path to the "license.dat" file is set correctly to 
             your LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable:

             % echo $LM_LICENSE_FILE

          E) Put the commands to set your LM_LICENSE_FILE environment
             variable in your shell start-up script (.cshrc, .kshrc, 
             or .profile files), to set your LM_LICENSE_FILE variable
             automatically each time you log in.
 
       5. Configure the license manager daemon to start each time you 
          boot your system.  You must have root privileges to complete
          this step, because you must edit your Unix system files. You 
          may need assistance from a system administrator.

          A) Create a nonprivileged "flexlm" user account.  Use this 
             separate, nonprivileged user account (not your regular 
             account, or root account) in step 5B. To create this user
             account, add this entry to your password file:

         flexlm:*:2000:250:FLEXlm License Manager:/nonexistent:/bin/sh
 
             This nonpriviledged account has the following 
             properties: 

             - Password set to '*' as interactive access is not 
               required.
               
             - A unique userid ("2000" is only an example).  No other 
               account should use this number.

             - A unique groupid ("250" is only an example).  No other 
               account should use this number.

             - A shell of /bin/sh
 
          B) To start the lmgrd license server every time your 
             machine boots, add the following as a long single line 
             to your "/etc/rc.local" file:

          su flexlm -c "<synplicity_home>/synplcty/<platform>/lmgrd \
          -l /usr/tmp/lmgrd.log -c <full_license_file_path>"

             Use the quotation marks as shown.

       6. Verify your authorization using the "lmstat" utility.  
          Enter the following string at the command prompt to execute 
          the "lmstat" utility:

          % <synplicity_home>/synplcty/<platform>/lmstat -a

          No errors should be reported. A message similar to the 
          following messsage should be returned:
 
       lmstat - Copyright (C) 1989-1994 Globetrotter Software, Inc.
       Flexible License Manager status on Wed 5/17/99 14:40
       License server status (License file: <full_license_file_path>):
       synplicity: license server UP (MASTER)
       Vendor daemon status (on <machine name>):
       synplctyd (v3.x): UP
       Feature usage info:
       Users of Synplify:  (Total of 1 licenses available)
 
         You can now run Synplify. If you have difficulties 
         installing or licensing Synplify, refer to the 
         Troubleshooting section below.

         Please fill out the Synplicity Software Registration Form 
         that came with your product shipment, then return it to 
         Synplicity.
            

   Troubleshooting

    If you have difficulties installing or licensing Synplify, please 
    read this section before contacting Synplicity or your local 
    technical support representative.

    If lmstat reports errors, read the log file "/usr/tmp/lmgrd.log".  
    The log file gives you hints about the problems, which can be 
    helpful when you are trying to resolve problems. Repeat the 
    Licensing steps as necessary.  Some common problems include: 
            
    - Typographical errors in the "license.dat" file.

    - An improperly set LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable. 
      See Step 4.

    - You have multiple Synplicity license manager daemons (lmgrd)
      executing.  In this case, "kill" the older process and try 
      again. 
  
    If you still have trouble, ask your system administrator for 
    assistance, or send email to support@synplicity.com. 

    When contacting Synplicity, please include:

    - Your "license.dat" file 

    - The "support.log" file.  Create the "support.log" file using 
      the following commands:

      % echo $LM_LICENSE_FILE > support.log
      % ps -auxw | grep lmgrd >> support.log
      % ps -auxw | grep synplctyd >> support.log
      % <synplicity_home>/synplcty/<platform>/lmstat -a >> support.log

Note: Based on your system environment, you might need to use the 
      ps -ef command instead of the ps -auxw command; the rest of 
      the command line remains the same.


E) Setting Up a UNIX Workstation Trial License (for Evaluations)

    Synplicity offers two types of Unix licenses, node-locked 
    and floating. With a node-locked Synplify license, you can 
    execute Synplify only on the machine for which it was 
    licensed.  With floating Synplify licenses, you and your 
    coworkers can execute Synplify across a network of Synplify-
    supported Windows NT, Sun Solaris, and HP HP-UX systems up
    to the number of seats supported by your license.

    To evaluate Synplify before purchasing it, you can download a 
    full-featured Synplify program which you can use for twenty days
    from our web site, http://www.synplicity.com. 
    
    To get an evaluation copy, visit the Synplicity web site and 
    download the software.  You must accept the licensing terms 
    and complete the trial request form before downloading the 
    software. After downloading and installing Synplify, execute
    the licensing wizard that pops up.

    Licensing Steps

    1. Run the license wizard:

       Enter "Synplify" at the command prompt to start the Synplify 
       software.  Synplify prompts you with a series of questions to 
       answer. Answer the questions, and either print and fax, or 
       email the form to Synplicity.

       If Synplify cannot automatically determine your <host_id> and 
       <host_name> strings:

       A) Determine your "hostid" by entering the following at the 
          command prompt:

          %  <synplicity_home>/synplcty/<platform>/lmhostid

	Replace <synplicity_home> with the complete pathname that
        describes the location of your Synplicity software.
        Replace <platform> with the machine type that hosts your
        license server.

      B) Determine your "hostname" by typing:
