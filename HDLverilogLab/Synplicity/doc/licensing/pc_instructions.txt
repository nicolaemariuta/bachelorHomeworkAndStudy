================================================================

A) Installing Synplify on a PC

   Installation Steps

        1. Insert the Synplify CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.

        2. Read the "readme.txt" file for pointers to additional 
           resources. To read the file, from the File Manager or 
           Explorer, double click on the file:

               <CD-ROM drive>:\pc\readme.txt

        3. Install the software from the File Manager or Explorer. 
           Double-click on the file: 

               <CD-ROM drive>:\pc\setup.exe

           You are guided through the installation process, which 
           creates the "synplcty" directory.

   If you are running Windows-NT 4.0, read the instructions below 
   for installing the Sentinel driver. However, if you are evaluating 
   Synplify, skip this section.
  
	Installing the Sentinel Driver
        The Sentinel driver is needed for all Windows NT applications
        protected by Rainbow security keys. You must install this 
        driver for your Synplify license to work on Windows 
	NT 3.51 and NT 4.0 systems. The driver files are located 
	in the "synplcty\sentinel" directory on your hard drive 
	after installation. To install the Sentinel driver, follow
        these directions. You must have administrator privileges 
        on your computer to install the Sentinel driver. 

	1.  Go to the synplcty\sentinel directory and double 
	    click on the "Setupx86.exe" file.

	2.  When the driver installation window opens, click
	    the Functions menu option and select the 
	    "Install Sentinel Driver" menu item.

	    A dialog box specifying the path to the 
            Sentinel driver for I386 pops up. 

        3.  Confirm that the path is correct, then click the OK.

	4.  After the driver is installed, a completion box appears,
            asking you if you want to restart your computer.
	    You must restart your computer to activate the driver. 

        Continue with the instructions for Configuring Your PC 
        License.

================================================================

B) Configuring a PC Customer License

        You must install Synplify before proceeding with 
        these licensing instructions.

        Synplicity offers these licenses:

          - a standard PC license enabled by an authorization code 
            and hardware security key (commonly called a dongle). 

          - a floating license enabled by an authorization code and 
            FLEXlm, a license server program.

	Be sure to follow the correct licensing instructions.

================================================================

C) Standard PC License

    Licensing Steps

        1. Install the Synplify hardware security key (dongle) 
           on your computer's parallel port.

        2. Locate your Synplicity Software Authorization Form in 
           your product shipment (or your authorization FAX or 
           email). Your Synplicity Software Authorization Form 
           contains your Synplify software license. If you are 
           missing this information, contact Synplicity:

                  phone: (408) 548-6000
                  email: support@synplicity.com
                  call your local technical support representative 

        3. Edit the license.txt file in your "synplcty" 
           directory, and type in your Synplify license.
         
        You are ready to run Synplify. If you have difficulties
        installing or licensing Synplify, contact Synplicity using 
        one of the options listed in step 2.    

        Please fill out the Synplicity Software Registration 
        Form that came with your customer shipment, then return 
        it to Synplicity.

================================================================

D) Special Floating License

    A floating license lets you run Synplify across Synplify-
    supported systems on your network.
    
    To enable your license, you must set up a license server 
    that monitors your Synplify licenses.  You can put the 
    license server on any Synplify-supported platform including a 
    Windows NT system or a Sun SPARCstation running Solaris.

    For instructions, refer to the appropriate section:

       - PC NT Machines as License Servers 
       - UNIX Workstations as License Servers, System 
         Administrators Setup Procedures 
       - UNIX Workstations as License Servers, Beginners 
         Setup Procedures 
 
================================================================

E) Configuring a PC Evaluation License

    To evaluate Synplify before making a purchase, you can request 
    a fully functional Evaluation License of Synplify, which lets you
    run a full-featured version of Synplify for twenty days.
    
    To get an evaluation copy, download the software from our
    website at http://www.synplicity.com.  After you accept our 
    licensing agreement and fill the evaluation license request form, 
    you can download the Synplify software.  After downloading and 
    installing Synplify, execute the licensing wizard that pops up.

    Licensing Steps

    For Evaluation PC Licenses, Synplify determines a hostid for your 
    machine and time locks Synplify to your machine.  Here's how 
    to request and enable your evaluation PC License:

    1. Run the license wizard

       Execute Synplify from the "Synplicity" program group in 
       Windows 95, 98, or Windows NT from the Start -> Synplicity -> 
       Synplify menu item.
 
       The Synplify user interface form pops up with a set of 
       questions to answer. Answer the questions.  Print and fax, 
       or email the form to Synplicity.

       Repeat the step above to confirm your hostid (sometimes the 
       hostid changes because of dial-up networking software). If 
       the hostid changes, add the "-nonet" command line argument to 
       the "Synplify" icon, and start again.  When your hostid is 
       stable, proceed to Step 2. 

       If you cannot get a stable hostid, contact Synplicity: 

                       phone: (408) 548-6000 
                       email:  support@synplicity.com 
                       call:   your local support representative 
 
       Note:  If you are using Windows 95 or 98, to add the "-nonet" 
              command line argument, access the Synplify "shortcut" 
              in your "C:\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Synplicity" 
              folder in Explorer.  Select "Synplify," click your 
              right mouse button, and select "Properties" from the 
              menu.  Add "-nonet" to the end of the "Target" path, 
              and click OK.
  
    2. Fax or email the license request form.

       A. Within North America, fax it to Synplicity at 
          (408) 548-0050 or email trial@synplicity.com.

       B. Outside of North America, fax it to your local sales 
          office. For help locating your local sales office, 
          view our web site at www.synplicity.com, or call us at 
          (408) 548-6000.
 
    3. Enter your Trial License into the "license.txt" file. 
       Upon approval of your request, Synplicity faxes or 
       emails your Trial License to you.  Enter the Trial 
       License information using the Synplicity license wizard 
       editor.  In the wizard introduction, choose edit or enter 
       license information.
 
    You are now ready to run Synplify. If you have difficulties 
    installing or licensing Synplify, contact Synplicity:
 
                    phone: (408) 548-6000 
                    email:  support@synplicity.com 
                    call:   your local support representative 

================================================================

F) Windows NT Machines as License Servers

    These instructions explain how to set up a Synplify license 
    server for both node-locked and floating licenses where the 
    license server is on a PC running Windows NT.
    
    Important!  If you purchased Synplify for the PC (but not a 
                floating license) and you want to run on Windows 
                NT, do not follow these instructions.  Instead, 
                follow the instructions for a standard PC 
                customer license.
    
    Before continuing, verify that TCP/IP is installed and that 
    the client machines can "ping" the server by name. You can 
    execute the "ping" command from an MS-DOS prompt by typing:

                 ping <host_name>
    
    If you installed Synplify on an NT computer, you were 
    given the option of installing FLEXlm licensing. If you did
    not select that option, please locate the Synplify CD and 
    install the FLEXlm for Windows NT option. This option is 
    only available for Windows NT computers. This creates 
    the "SYNLM" directory on your "C" disk, as "C:\SYNLM".  
    This directory name cannot be changed due to a limitation 
    in NT services.
    
    The directory "SYNLM" contains the files necessary to set 
    up a Windows NT computer as a floating license server.  
    It includes these files:

       FLEXLM.CPL   - Control Panel extension.	
       INSTALLS.EXE - Installs lmgrd.exe as an NT service.
       LMGR325C.DLL - FLEXlm licensing DLL.
       LMGRD.EXE    - The license server.
       LMUTIL.EXE   - FLEXlm utility for diagnosing, reporting,
                      or controlling your license configuration.
       SYND.EXE     - The Synplicity licensing daemon.

    Licensing Steps

    1. Locate your Synplicity Software Authorization Form in your 
       product shipment (or your authorization FAX or email). 
       Your Synplicity Software Authorization Form contains your 
       Synplify software license. If this information is absent, 
       email support@synplicity.com, call (408) 548-6000, or 
       call your local sales representative.
 
    2. Enter your authorization information.
       Edit the license.txt file located in your "synplcty" 
       directory, and type in your authorization information. 
       Copy your license file to "C:\SYNLM\LICENSE.DAT".
 
    3. Start the license using FLEXlm License Manager.
       In the Control Panel, double click on the FLEXlm License 
       Manager. In the Setup tab, type a name for the service.
       "Synplicity Floating License" for example.  Next, fill in 
       the path to:

       - Lmgrd.exe (this should be C:\SYNLM\lmgrd.exe)
       - License file (C:\SYNLM\license.dat)
       - Debug Log  (C:\SYNLM\debug.log)

       Then, click on the License tab to see your license file and 
       confirm all information is correct.  Now go back to the 
       Control tab and click the start service button.  A message 
       should appear that states, "Server Started."  To check the 
       status of your license, just click the "Status" button.   

    4. Set the license file variable (client).
       You must supply FLEXlm with the location of your Synplify 
       license for each computer on which Synplify is to execute.  
       The client computer need not be the same computer or even
       the same type of computer as the computer that hosts your 
       license server.  

       If your license server is on a Windows NT system and 
       serving a Unix client, follow the instructions in the 
       Unix license install instructions.
 
       In the following step, 4A or 4B, substitute 
       <portname>@<servername> into the command, as applicable.  
       This information is supplied by the SERVER line in your 
       "license.txt" file.
 
       For example, if your SERVER line is:   

       SERVER  bigdaddyhost  12345678  TCP:1701

       "bigdaddyhost" is the server name, and "1701" is the port 
       number.  The <portnumber>@<servername> string, in this 
       case, is "1701@bigdaddyhost."  Create your 
       <portname>@<servername> string before continuing.
 
       A) If your client is a PC running Windows NT, complete the
          following steps:

          1) Double click the "System" icon in the Control Panel.

          2) On the "Environment" tab, add SYNPLICITY_LICENSE_FILE 
             or LM_LICENSE_FILE to the "Variable" field.

          3) If you add SYNPLICITY_LICENSE_FILE to the "Variable"
             field, enter the <portnumber>@<servername> string in 
             the "Value" field.   If you add LM_LICENSE_FILE to 
             the "Variable" field, enter the path to "license.txt"
             file that authorizes your use of Synplify.

       B) If your client is a PC running Windows 95 or 98, add one of 
          the following lines to your "autoexec.bat" file:

          set SYNPLICITY_LICENSE_FILE=<portname>@<servername>

          or

          set LM_LICENSE_FILE=<path_to_license_file>

    5. Test your license server to confirm it is running.
       To verify that the license server is running properly, 
       set the LM_LICENSE_FILE path to the <path to license file>.
       Then, enter the following command at the MS-DOS prompt:

       lmutil lmstat -s <portnumber>@<servername> -a

       If the license server is running properly, this command 
       displays the available licenses and the current users 
       of those licenses.

    You can now run Synplify.  If you have difficulties installing
    or licensing Synplify, contact Synplicity:
