# This file (license.txt on the PC, license.dat on UNIX workstations) is used 
# to enter authorization information for Synplicity customers and evaluations.

# Please cut/paste or enter the FEATURE information from you authorization FAX 
# or email. Please include the VENDOR_STRING line. Check that there are no  
# characters or spaces after the backslash on the FEATURE line. If you 
# are unsure, remove the backslash and join the VENDOR_STRING line with the 
# FEATURE line to create a single FEATURE line.

# Example:
# FEATURE synplify_pc synplctyd 2.590 31-dec-99 0 12345678901234567890 \
# VENDOR_STRING=fpga HOSTID=SKEY=FFFFFFFF ck=00

# The format of your license may differ slightly from this example. There 
# may be additional SERVER or DAEMON lines that you will need
# to include. For more information on UNIX licensing, please refer to the 
# instructions file called "licinstr.txt" in your synplcty directory.

# On PC's, Synplify expects this file to be in your "synplcty" directory.
# If the variables SYNPLICITY_LICENSE_FILE or LM_LICENSE_FILE are set,
# Synplify will look for the license data in the files pointed to by
# those variables. Preference is given to SYNPLICITY_LICENSE_FILE
# On UNIX computers, LM_LICENSE_FILE must be set.
