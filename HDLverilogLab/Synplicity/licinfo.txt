        LICENSE.
Synplicity grants to Licensee, a nonexclusive right to use the SOFTWARE on
one computer system or on a networked computer system, using only the
number of nodes for which Licensee has a license and for which Licensee has
the security key(s) or authorization code(s) provided by Synplicity or its
agents.  All SOFTWARE must be used within the country for which the systems
were licensed and must be located at a single site (within a one-kilometer
radius.)  In addition, all authorized person(s) who access and use the
SOFTWARE must be within the country for which the systems were licensed and
must be located at a single site (within a one-kilometer radius from the
location of the SOFTWARE).

        COPY RESTRICTIONS.
This SOFTWARE and documentation is protected by United States copyright
laws and international treaty provisions.  Unauthorized copying of the
SOFTWARE in whole or in part is expressly forbidden.  Subject to these
restrictions, Licensee may (i) load the SOFTWARE onto one computer to
support authorized use and (ii) make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for
backup purposes, provided Licensee includes all copyright and trademark
notices on the back-up copy.  Licensee may not copy any part of the
documentation, nor modify, adapt, translate into any language, or create
derivative works based on the documentation without the prior written
consent of Synplicity.

        OWNERSHIP OF THE SOFTWARE.
Synplicity retains all right, title, and interest in the SOFTWARE and
documentation (and any copy thereof), and reserves all rights not expressly
granted to Licensee.  This License is not a sale of the original SOFTWARE
or of any copy.

        USE RESTRICTIONS.
This SOFTWARE is licensed to Licensee for internal use only.  Licensee
acknowledges that the scope of the licenses granted hereunder do not permit
Licensee (and Licensee shall not allow any third party) to: (i) decompile,
disassemble, reverse engineer or attempt to reconstruct, identify or
discover any source code, underlying ideas, underlying user interface
techniques or algorithms of the SOFTWARE by any means whatever, or disclose
any of the foregoing; (ii) provide, lease, lend, use for timesharing or
service bureau purposes, or otherwise use or allow others to use the
SOFTWARE for the benefit of third parties; (iii) modify, incorporate into
or with other software, or create a derivative work of any part of the
SOFTWARE; (iv) disclose the results of any benchmarking of the SOFTWARE, or

circumvent any user limits, maximum gate count limits or other license,
timing or use restrictions that are built in to the Software.

        TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS.
Licensee shall not sublicense, transfer or assign this Agreement or any of
the rights or licenses granted under this Agreement, except in the case of
a merger or sale of all or substantially all of Licensee's assets.

        OWNERSHIP OF DESIGN TECHNIQUES.
"Design" means the representation of an electronic circuit or device(s),
derived or created by Licensee through the use of the SOFTWARE in its
various formats, including, but not limited to, equations, truth tables,
schematic diagrams, textual descriptions, hardware description languages,
and netlists.  "Design Techniques" means the Synplicity-supplied data,
circuit and logic elements, libraries, algorithms, search strategies, rule
bases, and technical information incorporated in the SOFTWARE and employed
in the process of creating Designs.  Synplicity retains all right, title
and interest in and to Design Techniques incorporated into the SOFTWARE,
including all intellectual property rights embodied therein. Licensee
acknowledges that Synplicity is in the business of licensing SOFTWARE which
incorporates Design Techniques. Licensee agrees that in the event Licensee
voluntarily discloses any design techniques to Synplicity without
designating such as Licensee's Confidential Information, Synplicity shall
have the unrestricted, royalty-free right to incorporate such design
techniques into its software, documentation and other products, and to
sublicense third parties to use such incorporated design techniques.

        PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
"Confidential Information" means (i) the SOFTWARE, in object and source
code form, and any related technology, idea, algorithm or information
contained therein, including without limitation Design Techniques, and any
trade secrets related to any of the foregoing; (ii) either party's product
plans, Designs, costs, prices and names; non-published financial
information; marketing plans; business opportunities; personnel; research;
development or know-how; (iii) any information designated by the disclosing
party as confidential in writing or, if disclosed orally, designated as
confidential at the time of disclosure and reduced to writing and given to
the receiving party and designated as confidential in writing within thirty
(30) days; and (iv) the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided,
however that "Confidential Information" will not include information that:
(a) is or becomes generally known or available by publication, commercial
use or otherwise through no fault of the receiving party; (b) is known and
has been reduced to tangible form by the receiving party at the time of
disclosure and is not subject to restriction; (c) is independently
developed by the receiving party without use of the disclosing party's
Confidential Information; (d) is lawfully obtained from a third party who
has the right to make such disclosure; and (e) is released for publication
by the disclosing party in writing.

Each party will protect the other's Confidential Information from
unauthorized dissemination and use with the same degree of care that each
such party uses to protect its own like information. Neither party will use
the other's Confidential Information for purposes other than those
necessary to directly further the purposes of this Agreement. Neither party
will disclose to third parties the other's Confidential Information without
the prior written consent of the other party.

        TERMINATION.
Synplicity may terminate this Agreement in the event of breach or default
by Licensee.  Upon termination Licensee will relinquish all rights under
this Agreement, and must cease using the SOFTWARE and return or destroy all
copies (and partial copies) of the SOFTWARE and documentation.

        EXPORT.
Licensee agrees not to allow the Synplicity SOFTWARE to be sent or used in
any country except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations.

        LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.
Synplicity warrants (i) that the SOFTWARE will perform substantially in
accordance with the accompanying documentation for a period of ninety (90)
days from the date of receipt, and (ii) that the SOFTWARE will be able to
accurately process date data (including, but not limited to, calculating,
comparing, and sequencing) from, into and between the twentieth and
twenty-first centuries, provided that it is used in accordance with the
product documentation provided by Synplicity, that all associated products
(such as hardware, software, firmware and the like) used in combination
with the SOFTWARE properly exchange date data with it, and that Licensee
is covered under a services or maintenance agreement with Synplicity
regarding the SOFTWARE.  Synplicity's entire liability and Licensee's
exclusive remedy for a breach of the preceding limited warranties shall be,
at Synplicity's option, either (a) return of the license fee, or (b)
providing a fix, patch, work-around, or replacement of the SOFTWARE that
does not meet such limited warranty.  In either case, Licensee must return
the SOFTWARE to Synplicity with a copy of the purchase receipt or similar
document.  Any replacement will be warranted for the remainder of the
original warranty period or 30 days, whichever is longer.  Some states/
jurisdictions do not allow limitations on duration of an implied warranty,
so the above limitation may not apply.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE,
NO OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE BY
SYNPLICITY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND THE ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION
(STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE), AND SYNPLICITY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES
AND CONDITIONS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  SYNPLICITY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE
FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS, BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ALL DEFECTS IN THE PROGRAM WILL BE
CORRECTED.  Licensee assumes the entire risk as to the results and
performance of the SOFTWARE.  Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply.

        LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
LICENSEE AGREES THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL SYNPLICITY OR ITS AGENTS BE LIABLE
FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY
LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THESE SYNPLICITY
PRODUCTS, EVEN IF SYNPLICITY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.  In no event will Synplicity be liable to Licensee for damages in
an amount greater than the fees paid for the use of the SOFTWARE.  Some
states/jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of incidental
or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not
apply.

        INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT INFRINGEMENT.
In the event that a claim alleging infringement of an intellectual property
right arises concerning the SOFTWARE (including but not limited to patent,
trade secret, copyright or trademark rights), Synplicity in its sole
discretion may elect to defend or settle such claim.  Synplicity in the
event of such a claim may also in its sole discretion elect to terminate
this Agreement and all rights to use the SOFTWARE, and require the return
or destruction of the SOFTWARE, with a refund of the fees paid for use of
the SOFTWARE less a reasonable allowance for use and shipping.

        MISCELLANEOUS.
If Licensee is a corporation, partnership or similar entity, then the
license to the Software that is granted under this Agreement is expressly
conditioned upon acceptance by a person who is authorized to sign for and
bind the entity.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between Licensee
and Synplicity with respect to the license to the SOFTWARE, and supersedes
any previous oral or written communications or documents (including, if
you are obtaining an update, any agreement that may have been included with
the initial version of the Software). This Agreement is governed by the
laws of the State of California, USA.  This Agreement will not be governed
by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable,
it will be enforced to the extent permissible and the remainder of this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect.  Failure to prosecute a
party's rights with respect to a default hereunder will not constitute a
waiver of the right to enforce rights with respect to the same or any other
breach.

        GOVERNMENT USERS.
Use, reproduction, release, modification, or disclosure of this commercial
computer software, or of any related documentation of any kind, is
restricted in accordance with FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202, and further
restricted by this License Agreement.  Synplicity, Inc., 610 Caribbean
